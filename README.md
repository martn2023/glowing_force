This is my first self-directed project.

**PROJECT GOALS**:

	SCOPE AND SCALE:
  		1. Build something small enough appropriate for a novice
    	2. Build something that could extend to a larger project
    	3. Build something that is simple for much of the population to understand immediately

	DEMONSTRATION OF TECHNICAL CONCEPTS:
    	1. OOP, particularly on the encapsulation side
    	2. SRP
    	3. Extensibility, particularly with the maps
	    4. Data storage, particularly with the NPCs (INCOMPLETE)
	    5. The idea of a working game loop (SATISFCATORY)

	INTRODUCTION TO BEST PRACTICES:
	    1. Linting (Flake8) and industry coding standards (PEP8)
	    2. Storing and sharing code in GitHub
	    3. Better naming

  

**OVERVIEW**:

	"Glowing Force" is a tactical RPG (role-playing game) that is similar in style to SEGA's Shining Force, Nintendo's Fire Emblem series, and PlayStation's Final Fantasy Tactics. Stages/maps are 2-D grids where player-operated characters take turns moving around the board and fighting with NPCS.

STAGE 1: This game will be 100% text/terminal based.
STAGE 2: The next project will be a proof-of-concept with PyGame, where I will prove visuals
STAGE 3: Rebuild stage 1 with PyGame so the visuals match the backend code
STAGE 4: Rebuild stage 3 with more features

 **DOD**:
1. START SCREEN THAT ALLOWS PLAYER TO ENTER UNFINISHED MAPS
2. +2 maps with unique NPCs
3. +3 playable characters with different combat attributes (e.g. health points, armor, attack power)
4. Game loop that puts someone back at a Main Menu after failing a map, and ends when a player either quits OR finished all maps


**NOT IN SCOPE**:
	1. SAVED GAMES
	2. Custom characters
	3. NPC AI
 	4. Character drafting
  	5. Ability to inspect characters mid-game
	6. Graphics beyond terminal/ASCII
