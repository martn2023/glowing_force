BACKEND FLOW:




1. MAP CREATED
    A) ATTRIBUTES
        the map.status is going to determine
            whether the map/stage needs another round
            whether the round needs another turn, bc we assume the game can only end after a character's turn (whether death has occured)

    B) FUNCTIONS
        i. checking for a win condition e.g.
            if all NPCS have hp <= 0: "complete"
            elif all playables have hp <=0: "failed"
            else: pass


        ii. HIERCHACHY OF PLAYER DECISIONS
            stage > round > turn (move + attack)

            within a stage:
                we only check win status, then go to the next round (1).
                    win conditions should not be "all enemies are dead" because there might be a situation/erro where there's no enemies in the library. A better example would be checking if any enenmy has 1 hp
                doing a calculation would be redundant since this is being calculated at end of each turn
                DON'T FORGET THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHETHER DEAD PLAYERS ARE REVIVED OR LIVING PLAYERS HEALED TO FULL

            within a round:
                we check win condition, then decided if we even need additional TURNS
                at the start of the round, we determine turn chronology priority based on initiation scores (to be refreshed each turn in case something levels up)
                we then loop through the list announcing whether
                    it's a CHARACTER's turn
                    vs whether we are skipping the character due to its death

                    active turn


            within a turn:
                decide where you can move based on
                    distance
                    (UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED) what available coordinates are open (covered with default terrain), same as the search used in island counting
                    user will enter two coords and loop until it gets two numbers that link to an empty cell
                    set that index equal to the object, and set old map_matrix to blank terrain, and probably set up those xy coordinates within the object

                    assuming coords are different, print new map

                    at end of move, ACTIVATE ATTACKING
                    ask if it wants to attack any coords
                    user will enter 2 coords etc
                    if target has a Character, and character.playable == False:
                        CALL THE COMBAT FUNCTION WITH ATTACKING/DEFENDER


                combat:
                    attack gets to attack first and there's damage calculations
                        call COMBAT CALCULATOR FUNCTION
                    defender gets to counterattack there's damage calculations
                        call COMBAT CALCULATOR FUNCTION

                    if someone dies, announce their deaths, or else say both are still alive

                    if dead, replace on map with terrain

                combat_calculator function


2. COMBAT CALCULATIONS:

at this time, we dont have damage types e.g. physical vs magical (or within magical, different variants of magic)

    tools on table:



3. FURTHER TESTING
    when all my players die, will the map end
    where is the stage failed screen to report the outcome?
    if a map is failed, will it reset the map so you can try again
        also, will the hp of the characters reset?

    are we going to build a status check in so that you can see who's in the party, and what their stats are
